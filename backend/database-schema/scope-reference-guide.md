## üìù **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

1. **Scope Inheritance**: Some scopes automatically include others:
   - `sales.orders` includes `sales.quotes` (view)
   - `finance.approve` includes `finance.reports`
   - `operations.dispatch` includes `operations.planning` (view)

2. **Context-Sensitive**: Some scopes behave differently based on context:
   - `support.tickets` - EXTERNAL users can only create, not view all
   - `sales.orders` - Partners can only create for their customers
   - `finance.reports` - Scope limited by organization access

3. **Combinable**: Scopes work together:
   - `sales.quotes` + `sales.pricing` = Can create quotes with custom pricing
   - `support.tickets` + `support.escalate` = Full support capabilities
   - `operations.planning` + `operations.dispatch` = Complete scheduling control

**Remember**: Start with minimal scopes and add as needed. It's easier to grant additional capabilities than to revoke them!
