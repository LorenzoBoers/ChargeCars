# Active Context
**Current Status: Database Architecture Design - Implementation Planning Phase**

## Current Work Focus
Moving from completed PRD to technical implementation planning with new HubSpot-style database architecture design for scalable operations.

## Recent Accomplishments

### âœ… Complete PRD Package
1. **ChargeCars_Complete_PRD.md** (1,383 lines) - Full Dutch PRD with all sections
2. **ChargeCars_Complete_PRD_Nederlands.md** (981 lines) - Dutch version
3. **ChargeCars_Portal_Views_Requirements.md** (1,166 lines) - Detailed UI specifications
4. **PRD_Writing_Instructions.md** (615 lines) - Complete development guide
5. **ChargeCars_PRD_Template_Final.md** (506 lines) - Template with data

### âœ… System Analysis Complete
- **57,445 operational records** extracted from Smartsuite
- **45,124 automation operations** documented from Make.com
- **37 active scenarios** fully mapped
- Complete business process analysis across all 5 entities

### âœ… Memory Bank Established
- **projectbrief.md** - Core project definition and success criteria
- **productContext.md** - Problems solved and user experience goals
- **activeContext.md** - Current work status and next steps
- **progress.md** - Complete project phase tracking

### ðŸ†• New Database Architecture Design
- **ChargeCars_New_Database_Architecture.md** - Complete HubSpot-style schema
- Organization-contact hierarchy model
- Flexible line item billing system
- Sign-offs per line item (not per quote)
- Composite articles with configurable pricing
- Migration strategy from current Smartsuite structure

## Next Steps Priority List

### 1. **Database Architecture Validation** (Current Focus)
- Review proposed HubSpot-style schema with stakeholders
- Validate organization-contact model implementation
- Confirm flexible billing and sign-off workflows
- Finalize composite article and pricing structure

### 2. **Technical Architecture Decisions** (Phase 1)
- **Backend Platform**: Xano vs. alternatives evaluation
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js implementation planning
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL schema implementation
- **API Design**: RESTful API specification

### 3. **Migration Planning** (Phase 2)
- Data migration strategy from Smartsuite (57,445 records)
- API integration with existing Make.com workflows
- Gradual rollout vs. big-bang migration approach
- Data consistency and validation protocols

### 4. **Development Roadmap** (Phase 3)
- Portal development (customer, partner, operations, mobile)
- Integration optimization (Make.com, MoneyBird)
- AI-enhanced planning features
- Performance monitoring and analytics

## Active Decisions Needed
1. **Database Schema Approval**: Validate proposed HubSpot-style architecture
2. **Technology Stack Confirmation**: Xano backend vs. alternatives
3. **Migration Timeline**: Phased implementation strategy
4. **Resource Requirements**: Development team and budget allocation

## Current Focus Questions
- Does the organization-contact model properly address the billing complexity?
- Are the line item sign-offs flexible enough for various approval workflows?
- Does the composite article system support the package pricing requirements?
- Is the migration strategy realistic given the current 57,445 operational records?

## Files Requiring Immediate Attention
1. **ChargeCars_New_Database_Architecture.md** - Needs stakeholder review
2. Database migration planning documents (to be created)
3. Technical architecture decision documentation
4. Development timeline and resource planning

## Integration Points to Consider
- **Current Smartsuite**: 391 organizations, 6,959 customers, 5,576 orders
- **Make.com**: 37 active scenarios, 45,124 operations
- **New Architecture**: Support for 10x scaling (3,910+ partners)
- **Business Entities**: Integration across all 5 ChargeCars entities
