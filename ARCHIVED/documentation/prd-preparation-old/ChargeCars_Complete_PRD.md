# ChargeCars Unified Operations Platform - Complete PRD
**Product Requirements Document voor Digital Transformation**

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Transform ChargeCars from manual, fragmented operations across 5 business entities to a unified, automated platform supporting 10x partner growth (391 → 3,910+ partners) while maintaining operational excellence and partner-specific flexibility across Netherlands' EV charging ecosystem.

### Problem Statement
ChargeCars currently operates **57,445 operational records** across fragmented systems (Smartsuite, Make.com, ClickUp) with **391 active partners** and **7 regional teams**. The company manages **6,959 customers**, **5,576 orders**, and **5,197 visits** with impressive performance metrics (93.2% execution rate, 104.8% quote conversion).

### 2.6 Development Guidelines for AI

#### **Component Development Standards:**
```typescript
// Example component structure for AI development
interface ComponentTemplate {
  // 1. Type definitions first
  interface Props {
    data: DataType
    onAction: (action: ActionType) => void
    config?: ConfigType
  }
  
  // 2. Component with hooks
  const Component: React.FC<Props> = ({ data, onAction, config }) => {
    // State management
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
    const queryResult = useQuery(['key'], fetchData)
    
    // Event handlers
    const handleAction = useCallback((action) => {
      // Handle action
      onAction(action)
    }, [onAction])
    
    // Render with loading/error states
    if (queryResult.isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />
    if (queryResult.error) return <ErrorMessage />
    
    return (
      <div className="component-container">
        {/* Component JSX */}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

#### **API Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
// Standardized API hook pattern
const useEntityData = (entityId: string) => {
  return useQuery(
    ['entity', entityId],
    () => api.getEntity(entityId),
    {
      refetchInterval: 30000, // Real-time updates
      staleTime: 10000,
      cacheTime: 300000,
      onError: (error) => handleError(error),
      onSuccess: (data) => handleSuccess(data)
    }
  )
}
```

#### **State Management Pattern:**
```typescript
// Redux slice template
const entitySlice = createSlice({
  name: 'entity',
  initialState: {
    items: [],
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    filters: {},
    pagination: {}
  },
  reducers: {
    setLoading: (state, action) => {
      state.loading = action.payload
    },
    setItems: (state, action) => {
      state.items = action.payload
    },
    updateItem: (state, action) => {
      const index = state.items.findIndex(item => item.id === action.payload.id)
      if (index !== -1) {
        state.items[index] = action.payload
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Deze uitgebreide UI/Portal sectie geeft AI development tools alle specifieke informatie, componenten, interacties en data flows die nodig zijn om de complete ChargeCars portal te bouwen. Elke view is gedetailleerd uitgewerkt met concrete TypeScript interfaces, component specificaties en development tasks.
